                <p>ABOUT ME</p>
            </div><br>
            <p>My name is Gabriel, I'm from Brazil and I’m 16 years old. I'm currently in my second year of high school. I'm enrolled in an integrated program called "Internet Informatics", which combines high school with a technical course. It was through this program that I took my first steps into programming.<br><br>I've been passionate about technology since I was a kid. I had access to the internet at a very young age (not recommended :P). I’ve always liked Windows operating systems, which led me to enjoy exploring tech in general. However, I hadn’t yet discovered a love for programming — that only came when I started the Informatics course in 2024.<br><br>Since the beginning, I’ve been sure that this is the path I want to follow in life.<br><br>And that's it! :)</p><br>

            <p>I currently have advanced knowledge of HTML and CSS. This year, I started learning JavaScript and TypeScript. I’m also studying PHP, SQL, and C#.<br><br></p>
